### Making Cars ###

This project is our first foray into OOP. Involves members, constructors. Also used to learn about images and resources.

### Conways Game of Life ###

Culmination of Programming 1, this project was a group oriented project. Featuring efficient operation, our program put a modern spin on this classic game.

I learned how to use hashmaps in Java and had a lot of fun making the grid class.



### Calculator ###



This project is a graphical scientific calculator built using the Processing programming environment. The calculator features a custom UI with clickable buttons and supports both basic arithmetic operations and scientific functions such as sine, cosine, square root, and exponential calculations.

The layout dynamically scales based on SCALE, and buttons are created programmatically. A unique feature is that numeric button positions are randomized on startup, making each session visually different.

A sound effect is played on every button press using the SoundFile class from the Processing Sound library.
Contains all basic operands, exponential functions, divide by 0 protection, sine, cosine, sqrt. Supports negatives and decimals.
Keys are randomized on startup for added effect.

Processing (Java-based): For graphics, UI, and interaction

Processing Sound Library: For playing sound effects

OOP: Button, Display, and operator handling are modularized
